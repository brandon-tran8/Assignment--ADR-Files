# Scenario 2

## Type of Development Approach for the University Social Networking Application

### Status

- Proposed


### Context

The team university doesn't have a social networking app where students can connect with each other, share information classes, view events and clubs, and manage their schedules. In addition, a way for professors to post their announcements, assignments, and grades. With this mind, the team needs to decide what type of development approach they want to take to incorporate the various requirement like platform support, offline mode functionality, performance optimization, integration with an Active directory system, push notifications, data privacy, security, and inclusivity. 


### Decision

The decision is to develop the University app as a *hybrid application* based on the following features listed. 

### Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

- Making the app for both iPhone and Android is easier as we only have to code it once.
  
- Students are still able to use parts of the app if they don't have internet, like checking the their schedule.

- The app is able to run smoothly and use less data when the student isn't using the latest phone. 

- Students information is safe when they are logging and they're the only one that can see their information.

- Students are able to get important updates about their grades, messages, and events on any of their devices.

- Students personal information like grades and messages are private and safe 

- Anyone can use the app even if they are not familiar with today technology.
