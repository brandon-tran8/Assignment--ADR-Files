- With using React as the framework, it will be a user friendly interface as it's easy for the student to navigate and ensuring they are have a good experience.
  
- React Native is also cross-platform, which means UI components can be shared between iOS and Android. Makes coding consistent throughout the app. 

- Since components are cross-platform we are able to reuse code! With being able to reuse code, we can reduce the time it takes to develop the app.  

- React is also offers responsive design capabilities where it's able to adjust between screens sizes and the orientation of the device. 

- React is scalable, with it being scalable the app is able to continue grow and evolve over time.
