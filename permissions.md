# Scenario 2

## Type of Permission Model To Manage Features and Data for the University Social Networking Application

### Status

- Proposed


### Context

The team needs to decide what type of permission model that is going to work well with this university app. 


### Decision

The decision is to use *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* to manage the permissions in the University app.

### Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this decision?

- RBAC is able to accommodate the growth in user population and application complexity, as RBAC is able to easily scale to meet the change in permission requirements. 
  
- Makes sure that the student/professor is able to have access to the features and data they needs to perform their tasks effectively, without having unnecessary restrictions or permissions. 

- Helps simplifies permission management as it allows the team to organize the students/professors into roles and define the type of permissions they at a role level. By doing this it makes it easier to manage permissions across the large user population.

- Provides an audit trail of users roles and permissions, making it easier to track and monitor access to features and data within the app. Doing this ensures to maintain compliance within the policies requirements and security.
